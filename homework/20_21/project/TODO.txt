1.	Insert into the Parse module all useful definitions for the parser, as reported in chapter 13 of the text book (
	as the implementation of the project proceeds, a little tuning on definitions maybe needed)		DONE

2. 	Copy into the ParseProg module all the type definitions for the specific parser for CorePrograms;	DONE

3. 	Study the chapter 1.6 of the textbook;
	a.	Study and implement the lexical analysis tool (NOTE: the last exercise of the lexical analysis paragraph
		 has been ignored, because it has been deemed as not important: the line of a syntax error seems not to 
		be requested in tests) REMEMBER THIS POINT IN CASE OF FAILURE					DONE
	b.	Study the paragraph "Basic tools for parsing"

4. 	Test the first part of the Parser by comparing local results with the output of provided tests;

5. 	Read and understand what is needed for the second part of the project;

6. 	Implement the second part of the project.

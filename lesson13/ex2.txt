Show why outermost evaluation is preferable to innermost for the purposes of evaluating the expression "fst(1 + 2, 2 + 3)"


If we use the innermost evaluation strategy this means that both the parameters will be completely evaluated before being passed to "fst". The second parameter could have been an infinite list: boom, non-termination!.
If we use outermost evaluation then the second parameter isn't even touched, and the scenario presented above cannot happen.
